Last Updated: May 30, 2025

Welcome to AI Companion (Fire)! This Privacy Policy explains how [Your App Name] ("we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, and protects your personal information when you use our Streamlit application.

1. Information We Collect

When you log in to AI Companion (Fire) using Google OAuth, we collect the following information from your Google account:

Google User ID (sub): A unique, persistent identifier for your Google account. This is our primary identifier for your profile in our database.
Email Address: Your primary email address associated with your Google account.
Name: Your full name as provided by your Google account.
Conversations/User Input: Any text or data you input into our application, including your conversations with our AI features, are stored to provide service functionality and improve our application. This data is linked to your Google User ID.
2. How We Use Your Information

We use the collected information for the following purposes:

Authentication and Personalization: To authenticate your identity when you log in and to provide you with a personalized experience within the application, such as linking your conversations to your user profile.
Service Delivery: To enable the core functionality of the application, including storing and retrieving your conversations.
Application Improvement: To analyze usage patterns and feedback to improve the performance, features, and user experience of [Your App Name]. We may use aggregated or pseudonymized data for this purpose.
Security: To maintain the security and integrity of our application and data.
3. Data Storage and Security

Storage Location: Your data, including user profiles and conversations, is stored in a database managed by us. If deployed on Streamlit Community Cloud, this database is typically external (e.g., SQLite file on the server for testing, or a separate cloud database for production).
Security Measures: We implement reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect your information from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. This includes encryption of sensitive data fields at the application level before storage in the database.
Anonymity/Pseudonymity: While your conversations are linked to your Google User ID (which itself is unique to your Google account), we treat this data with the utmost care. We strive to process and analyze data in a pseudonymized form where possible for analytical purposes, meaning direct personal identifiers are separated or minimized.
4. Data Retention

We retain your personal information and conversation data for as long as necessary to provide you with the service and for legitimate business purposes, such as maintaining app functionality and improving our services. If you wish to have your data deleted, please contact us at [Your Support Email Address].

5. Disclosure of Information to Third Parties

We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your personally identifiable information to outside parties. This does not include trusted third parties who assist us in operating our application, conducting our business, or serving our users, so long as those parties agree to keep this information confidential and comply with data protection laws. We may also release information when its release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce our site policies, or protect ours or others' rights, property, or safety.
